Bayesian inference has advantages for archaeologists that extend well beyond the realm of radiocarbon calibration and chronological modeling. The NHST framework has served archaeologists well for many years, but has limitations. Unfortunately, NHST bases inference on new data alone due to its inherent structure. Its language and assumptions can be convoluted and confusing, and the approach cannot be used to directly compare multiple working hypotheses. Bayesian inference overcomes many of these problems for archaeologists. In many ways, archaeologists often think through problems using a Bayesian framework without knowing they are doing so and without using a formal probabilistic framework. Like the Bayesian archaeologist in our parable, most archaeologists do not form inferences about the past using new data isolated from the existing body of knowledge. Instead, we continually update our prior knowledge with new evidence to make decisions, form opinions and generate conclusions. The advantage of Bayesian inference over NHST is that it affords archaeologists 1) a more natural toolkit to learn from data, 2) straightforward language to make hypotheses quantifiable, explicit and transparent, and 3) the ability to use probability for comparing multiple hypotheses and conducting further evaluation.

Consequently, *the Bayesian approach represents a paradigm shift in archaeological inference*. Bayesian statistics offers a coherent inferential framework that explicitly outlines the way in which oneâ€™s prior information is updated with new data to produce the current state of knowledge. The process helps to evaluate the degree to which current and new evidence support hypotheses. This may be conducted iteratively until there is a desirable amount of confidence (or lack thereof) in the accuracy of a hypothesis. In this context, the Bayesian framework resembles a learning process not unlike scientific investigation. For example, archaeologists continually update their knowledge and degree of belief in hypotheses using new information gathered through multiple data collection methods, including excavation, survey, experimental, laboratory and other analytical activities.

An increasing number of archaeologists are using Bayesian statistics to calibrate radiocarbon dates, build chronologies and evaluate their hypotheses about the past. The popularity of chronology-related Bayesian software has made Bayesian inference in that context a simple operation, meaning that most users will find the software easy to operate without a basic understanding of the logic of Bayesian inference and its three fundamental components: the likelihood, the prior and the posterior. Moreover, without such fundamental understanding, the analytical power of Bayesian statistics, beyond chronology construction, may not be obvious, thus slowing rather than enhancing more general adoption. 

To mitigate this problem, this paper highlights how archaeologists may use Bayesian inference to approach complex questions through a simple fictional example. This approach allows archaeologists to evaluate, compare and update their hypotheses directly, using the weight of evidence and a straightforward process. We consider this one of the most significant impacts of the Bayesian paradigm. In addition, Bayesian inference requires archaeologists to become cognizant of and transparent about prior and current information for statistical analyses within a probabilistic structure. The framework explicitly incorporates all information (prior and current) to enable a more comprehensive understanding of a problem.

As a result, applications of this method are conducive to replication, allowing them to be improved upon by other archaeological scientists. In this light, Bayesian inference dovetails with ongoing efforts to promote open science methods and open data in archaeological research. This context encourages researchers to outline the entire logical process that underlies their results. Due to its advantages, we believe that Bayesian inference is well-positioned to become a standard approach to evaluating quantitative hypotheses in archaeology.
