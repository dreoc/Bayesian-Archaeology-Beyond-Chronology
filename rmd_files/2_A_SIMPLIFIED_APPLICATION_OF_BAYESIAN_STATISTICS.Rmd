### The Bayesian archaeologist and the Monico culture

The “Monico culture” is a fictitious group of people who might have lived between the ethnographic present and long ago across multiple environmental settings and sociocultural contexts worldwide. The imaginary archaeological record of the Monico is well known. In general, their material culture reflects patterns of foraging, farming, and pastoralist economies. Monico sociocultural dynamics are broad. They range from egalitarian practices exhibited at highly mobile camps to a greater social complexity derived from more permanent settlements. Some Monico experts argue that later Monico settlements show evidence of intensive food production, trade of exotic goods, and a highly centralized political organization administered by an increasingly hierarchical elite.

A famous Bayesian archaeologist, an authority on the Monico, has excavated a post-contact period site associated with this culture. Excavation work at the site, named Monico-1, has yielded an impressive faunal assemblage among the widely diverse material culture. The archaeofauna is composed of two species of animals: “dog” and “coyote.” Individual animals of both species are represented by complete skeletons. Consequently, in this report the archaeologist uses the term "individual" to refer to complete dogs or coyotes. Likewise, when the archaeologist mentions "the number of" dogs or coyotes, they mean a count of complete individuals of the representative species. So far, the archaeologist has identified 100 such individuals and assigned them to their respective species. Based on the observations, the assemblage is composed of 71 dogs and 29 coyotes (Figure 2).

```

However, the archaeologist has also excavated a bone fragment that is difficult to identify. The archaeologist wishes to know the most probable species to which this fragment belongs.

The archaeologist defines “probability” as the relative frequency or proportion of times that an event occurs. On the basis of the data alone, the probability (P) of dog remains in the assemblage is:

$$P(Dog) = \dfrac{71}{100}= 0.71.$$


whereas the probability of coyote remains is: 

$$P(Coyote) = \dfrac{29}{100}= 0.29.$$


Given these probabilities, it is reasonable for the archaeologist to believe that the unidentifiable bone specimen is more likely to be from a dog. However, the archaeologist is skeptical. Moreover, as a Monico scholar, the archaeologist possesses ethnographic details on the Monico people’s behavior, particularly on their eating taboos. Historical accounts reveal that the Monico once maintained hunting dogs in their villages to hunt coyotes. Because the Monico’s traditional subsistence base was dependent mainly on coyote hunting, dogs developed special relationships with their owners. Consequently, the Monico came to treat their dogs respectfully, as they would other people. 

Oral histories passed down over generations have documented that dogs were thought to be a close sibling of people. Notably, the Monico culture is known to have had taboos against killing or eating dogs. However, oral histories have also revealed that the Monico did eat dogs during times of resource scarcity. With this additional or “prior” information, the archaeologist decides to observe the skeletons more closely to check for the presence of butchery marks (i.e., cut marks) on the dog remains. The archaeologist tabulates this additional information on the recovered bones under two butchery conditions: 1) butchery marks are present, and 2) butchery marks are absent. Table 1 shows the frequencies of butchery marks on the skeletons of each species.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
cap<-"Frequencies of individual animals and observed butchery marks at Monico 1. Note that while most of the butchery marks are on coyote bones, 9 of the 71 dog bones also show signs of butchery."
df<- data.frame ( a= c("Present", "Absent", "Total individuals"),
                  Coyote =c(23, 6,29),
                  Dogs = c(9, 62, 71),
                  Total_Butchery_marks = c(32,68,100))

df<- data.frame(df[-1], row.names=df[,1]) 

kbl(df, caption = cap) %>% kable_material %>% 
    add_header_above(c("", "Individuals of Each Species" = 2, "" )) %>%
    column_spec(4, color ="white", background = "black") %>%
    row_spec(3, bold=T, color="white", background ="black") %>% 
    kableExtra::pack_rows("Butchery Marks", 1,2)%>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```
To convert these data into a probability table, the archaeologist standardizes (or divides) all of the values by the total number of observations (100 in this case). The inner cells (dark font, light shading) in Table 2 provide the probabilities of butchery marks and species occurring together, or jointly, and are thus known as joint probabilities. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
cap<-"Joint probabilities of individual animals and observed butchery marks, which describe the probability of identifying a species and observing butchery marks on the bones of that species; for example, P(Coyote and Butchery mark present) is 0.23, or 23\\%."
df2<- data.frame ( a= c("P(Present)", "P(Absent)", "Marginal Species"),
                  "P(Coyote)"= c(23/100, 6/100, 29/100),
                  "P(Dogs)" = c(9/100, 62/100, 71/100),
                  Marginal_Butchery_marks = c(32/100,68/100,"Total = 1"))

df2<- data.frame(df2[-1], row.names=df2[,1]) 

kbl(df2, caption = cap) %>% kable_paper %>% 
    add_header_above(c("", "Species Identified" = 2, "" )) %>%
    column_spec(4, color ="white", background = "black") %>%
    row_spec(3, bold=T, color="white", background ="black") %>% 
    kableExtra::pack_rows("Butchery Marks", 1,2)%>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

The values in the right and bottom margins of Table 2 are suitably named “marginal probabilities”. These represent the presence and absence of butchery marks (on the right) and the species identified (bottom). The marginal totals are the total probabilities of each subsetted space (species or butchery mark). By definition, all probabilities lie in the range of 0 to 1, and the total sum of the marginal rows or columns (i.e., the sum over all marginal outcomes) must be 1. 
At this point, the archaeologist focuses on the unidentifiable bone specimen and finds several butchery marks on it. The archaeologist can use this additional information to gain an inferential advantage by accounting for, or conditioning on, the presence of butchery marks—a process called “conditioning”. The archaeologist conditions the species identified on the presence or absence of butchery marks. This procedure is otherwise known as subsetting or stratifying the variable “species identified” by the “presence” or “absence” of butchery marks.
Naturally, the archaeologist asks, “What is the probability that the unidentifiable bone specimen is from a dog compared to the probability that it is from a coyote, given that butchery marks are present on the bones of an individual?” The archaeologist observed 32 animals from Monico-1 with butchery marks present. Of those, butchery marks were present on 9 dogs and 23 coyotes. The archaeologist can thus calculate the probabilities of the individual belonging to one species or the other, given that butchery marks are present (statisticians use the “|” symbol below to mean “given that” and to signify that conditioning is taking place). For a dog, the probability is:


$$P(\text{Dog | Butchery mark present}) = \dfrac{9}{32}= 0.28.$$

whereas the probability that an individual with butchery marks belongs to the coyote species is: 

$$P(\text{Coyote | Butchery mark present}) = \dfrac{23}{32}= 0.72.$$

Therefore, after observing butchery marks on the individual (unidentified) bone, the archaeologist can state that the probability is 0.72 that it came from a coyote. In other words, the archaeologist is 72% certain that the bone was part of a coyote.
A few days later, a local newspaper reporter became aware of an ongoing archaeological excavation at another Monico village site nearby, named Monico-2. Sources reveal to the reporter that the excavators there are also recovering faunal remains. Because the archaeologist is a well-known expert on the Monico’s eating habits, the reporter contacts the archaeologist and communicates the fact that the new faunal assemblage at Monico-2 is wholly composed of remains from dog species. 
Even though the investigators at Monico-2 have not yet conducted a thorough faunal analysis, the reporter asks the archaeologist how likely it is that the Monico were butchering and eating dogs at the new site. By now, the archaeologist has estimated the probabilities of finding butchery marks associated with each animal species based on experience at the Monico-1 village. To make a probabilistic inference about behavior at the new site, the archaeologist conditions on the “species identified” instead of on the “presence of butchery marks.” Out of the 71 dogs identified, the archaeologist observed 9 with butchery marks and 62 without. This means that, based on the evidence from Monico-1, the probability of finding evidence of butchery on dogs is:

$$P(\text{ Butchery mark present | Dog}) = \dfrac{9}{71}= 0.13.$$

whereas the probability of no butchery evidence on dogs is: 

$$P(\text{ Butchery mark present | Coyote}) = \dfrac{62}{71}= 0.87.$$

After a moment’s thought, the archaeologist tells the reporter that (based on knowledge from Monico-1) the probability of the dog bones from Monico-2 having resulted from dietary activities is relatively low at around 13%. This calculation draws on Bayes’ theorem, as well as the information regarding the Monico’s relationship with their dogs and the butchery practices at Monico-1.
